"""Git integration: materialize a list of :class:`ScanTarget` from git state.

This module is the *only* place the package touches git. Keeping it small
and isolated means every other module (rules, scanner, CLI formatter) can
be exercised from pytest without a real repo.

The integration uses ``git diff --cached`` rather than walking the working
tree so we scan exactly what's about to land in the commit — no more, no
less. That means:

* Untracked files that haven't been ``git add``'d are ignored (correctly).
* Partial stages (``git add -p``) are respected.
* Deletions produce no scan targets (there's nothing to leak in a diff
  that only removes lines).
